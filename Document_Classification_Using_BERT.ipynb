This amended report supersedes the previous report dated July 2020.\\n\\nG:\\\\2019 WORK\\\\CANBERRA 24 Eric\\\\CONSENT 2\\\\S.92\\\\Oct 2020 AEE Revised\\\\7502 - 24 Canberra Rd - LUC & SUB RC application\\n\\nrevision.docx\\n\\n4\\n\\n24 Canberra Avenue, Lynfield Resource Consent Application\\n\\nThe proposal is for a four-lot subdivision removing the existing house and constructing four new houses.\\nThe total existing site area is 941m\\xc2\\xb2.\\nAn application was made in mid-2019 and this new application makes some changes to overall coverages, outlook & external design layout and answers some further information questions under S.92 of the RMA. A new accessway is proposed along the southern boundary to maximise the outdoor areas for the proposed housing.\\nThe existing vehicle crossing will be returned to footpath.\\nA unique component for houses in this part of Canberra Ave is that they back onto a large Council reserve being Wattle Bay Reserve.\\nAccess to this passive recreational area is limited, there is a public access point between 34 & 36 Canberra Ave to the south.\\nThe applicant proposes to create an internal private pedestrian access point to the park for the prospective owners of lots1-4.\\nThe applicant is also the owner of 22 Canberra adjoining to the north.\\nThis site at 22 Canberra will be developed in the near future with a new driveway to its southern boundary which adjoins the subject site.\\nThere is a minor effect on this site in terms of height in relation to boundary and outlook infringements, although it to the south of their site.\\nIt may also have a private pedestrian access incorporated into the overall design as it is subdivided in the future.\\nThis further increases the distance between houses on the two sites and helps mitigate any infringement.\\nEach of the houses will be over two levels with the design of the front house on Lot 1 addressing the road with its pedestrian access, orientation & outlook to the road.\\nThis generally meets the urban design and public surveillance protocols.\\nThe houses on lots 2-4 have the same floor plan (room layout) with lots 2 & 3 being identical and lot 4 being the same floor plan but with larger room areas particularly for the upper floor.\\nProposed Lot 1 to the west and closest to the road has a gross site area of 240m\\xc2\\xb2 & net area of 183m\\xc2\\xb2 with a house footprint area of 78.2m.\\nProposed Lot 2 & Lot 3 have a gross site area of 240.5m\\xc2\\xb2 & net area of 183.4m\\xc2\\xb2 with a house footprint area of 79.9m.\\nProposed Lot 4 is the rear lot backing onto the Council reserve and has a gross site area of 221.1m\\xc2\\xb2 & net area of 206.1m\\xc2\\xb2 with a house footprint area of 85m.\\nThe proposed houses on Lot 1-4 are over two levels.\\nLot 1 has the ground floor containing a single garage, laundry, entrance, toilet and stairway along with a kitchen and living area.\\nThe upper level has a master bedroom with ensuite, three additional bedrooms and a bathroom.\\nLots 2-4 have the ground floor containing a single garage, laundry, entrance, bedroom, bathroom and stairway along with a kitchen and living area.\\nThe upper levels have a master bedroom with ensuite, two additional bedrooms, a small lounge and a bathroom.\\nEach of the house\\'s steps down to the road, there are small retaining walls as shown on drawings RC-A-03, RC-A-16 & the elevations.\\nThere are no overlooking windows internally between the houses, therefore the internal daylight rule is easily met.\\nThe general height in relation to boundary rule H4.6.5 is infringed along the northern side boundary and the alternative rule H4.6.6 is utilised and generally meets the listed criteria for the northern boundaries of proposed Lots 1 and lot 2.\\nThe proposal infringes both the general & alternative height in relation to boundary rule.\\n\\nThe maximum impervious rule H4.6.8 is 65.8% or 55m\\xc2\\xb2 over for the total site.\\nThe individual lots are shown on the sheet 1 table of the plans.\\nThe outlook space rule H4.6.11 is infringed for the principal living rooms (6m by 6m) for lots 2-4 where the outlook area projects 1m into the side neighbours\\' site at 22 Canberra Ave.\\nEach of the houses have another large living room widow on the eastern wall with a further smaller outlook.\\n\\nThe outdoor living area rule H4.6.13 (1) (a) is infringed on proposed Lot 1where the dimension is less than the required 4m at 3.03m.\\nThe area at 3.03m continues in front of the house and living room area and overall is\\n\\nG:\\\\2019 WORK\\\\CANBERRA 24 Eric\\\\CONSENT 2\\\\S.92\\\\Oct 2020 AEE Revised\\\\7502 - 24 Canberra Rd - LUC & SUB RC application\\n\\nrevision.docx\\n\\n5\\n\\n24 Canberra Avenue, Lynfield Resource Consent Application\\n\\nlarger than the 20m\\xc2\\xb2 that would be required.\\nThe available conforming area is 17.8m\\xc2\\xb2.\\nThere is an area of 12m\\xc2\\xb2 to the north-east with access from the laundry and with outlook from the kitchen as mitigation.\\n\\nThe Yard rule H4.6.7 (1) is technically infringed by the handrail of a small deck in the front yard which means (arguably) that the deck becomes a building in the front yard as the deck handrail is 1.97m over original ground level.\\nThis is extremely minor in degree and I do not believe this should be a reason for consent.\\nHowever, we are applying for it in order to progress the application.\\nUnder the same rule there is also a retained part of the rear yard where it adjoins the Open Space zone.\\nThe small retaining wall is 0.6m in ground and within 1.5 metre of that rear boundary being 0.5m away.\\nThe definition in Chapter J1 states \"Retaining walls or breastwork Over 1.5m in height or located within 1.5m of the boundary of a road or public place\" is a building.\\nThe front yard fence has a 1.8m high component from the northern boundary down to the centrally located front pedestrian gate rather than the 1.4m height which is required.\\nThe higher fence has been proposed to allow for greater privacy in the front yard outdoor living area.\\nThis component infringes rule H4.6.14 and H4.8.2 (2) (vii).\\nThe site is within a Stormwater Management Area Control Hillsborough 1, Flow 2 and this is fully discussed in appendix E and is a restricted discretionary activity under rule E10.4.1(A3).\\nThe overall earthworks for the site will involve virtually the whole site to be cleared where the site is stepped down to the road including retaining walls, building platforms and the construction of the driveway.\\nThe earthwork rule E12.4.1 (A3) & (A7) is infringed the applicant has provided an earthwork management plan in appendix H. The existing vehicle crossing will be removed and reinstated to Auckland Transport standards.\\nA new crossing to the south will serve each of the lots with a small infringement to rule E27.4.4.1(T157) (3) where the gradient over the first 4m from the road boundary does not meet the 1:20 gradient.\\nThe proposed driveway goes down to the road and in this case the infringement arises due to drainage engineering reasons where the levels proposed are due to existing manhole cover levels within that area of the site.\\nThe engineering drawings in appendix D cover this area of non-compliance.\\nThe subdivision is shown on the scheme plan in appendix A where proposed drainage connections are shown along with proposed easements.\\nDrainage engineering design plans is attached as Appendix C. The proposed subdivision meets the general standards under rule E38.4.2 (A14) & E38.8.2.1.\\n\\n3 REASONS FOR THE APPLICATION\\n\\nUnder the AUP OP the site is zoned Residential Mixed Housing Suburban.\\nResource Consent is required for the following reasons.\\n\\n* Rule H4.4.1 (A4) Where four or more dwellings per site require a restricted discretionary activity assessment.\\nWhere Rule H4.6.5 Height in Relation to Boundary and Rule H.6.6.6 Alternative height in relation boundary are not met.\\nWhere under the relevant assessment criteria of H4.8.2 (2) the additional rules outlined below are assessed;\\n\\n1. Rule H4.6.8 Maximum Impervious Area where the total site is 65.8% or over by 55m\\xc2\\xb2.\\n2. Rule H4.6.11 Outlook is infringed for the principal living rooms for lots 2 & 3 where there is a partial building obstruction and then for lots 2-4 where the outlook area projects into the side neighbours site at 22 Canberra Ave.\\n\\n3. Rule H4.6.13 Outdoor Living Space for lot 1 is 17.8m\\xc2\\xb2 rather the 20m\\xc2\\xb2 required.\\n\\n4. Rule H4.6.13 Fencing in part of the front yard is 1.8m high rather than the 1.4m required.\\nThis requires a restricted discretionary assessment.\\n\\nG:\\\\2019 WORK\\\\CANBERRA 24 Eric\\\\CONSENT 2\\\\S.92\\\\Oct 2020 AEE Revised\\\\7502 - 24 Canberra Rd - LUC & SUB RC application\\n\\nrevision.docx\\n\\n6\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\n* *\\n\\n24 Canberra Avenue, Lynfield Resource Consent Application\\n\\nRule H4.8.2 94) a-d Height in relation to boundary along the southern boundary with 22 Canberra Ave.\\nThis requires a restricted discretionary activity assessment.\\n\\nRule H4.6.7 (1) Yards where a front deck handrail is 1.97m high in the front yard and an inground 0.6m retaining wall is within 0.5m of the rear boundary where it adjoins an Open Space zone.\\nThis requires a restricted discretionary activity assessment.\\n\\nRule E10.4.1 (A3) Stormwater Drainage is affected as the site is within a Stormwater Management Area Control Hillsborough 1, Flow 2.\\nThis requires a restricted discretionary activity assessment.\\n\\nRule E12.4.1 (A3) & (A7) Earthworks is infringed and is over the permitted 500m\\xc2\\xb2 for the area but less than 1000m\\xc2\\xb2 and over the 250m\\xc2\\xb3 but less than the 1000m\\xc2\\xb3.\\nThis requires a restricted discretionary activity assessment.\\n\\nRule E27.6.4.4.1(T157) (3) Access is infringed where; Gradient of vehicle access (1) the gradient of the access must not be steeper than specified in Table E27.64.4.1 Gradient of vehicle access(T157) Figure E27.6.4.4.3 Gradient transition.\\nThis requires a restricted discretionary activity assessment.\\n\\nRule E38.8.2.2 where subdivision is around existing or approved buildings on proposed lot 1- 4.\\nThis requires a discretionary activity assessment as rule E27.6.4.4.1(T157) (3) is infringed.\\n\\nRule E38.4.2 (A14) & E38.8.2.1 Subdivision requires a restricted discretionary assessment.\\n\\nOverall, the land use proposal is a restricted discretionary activity.\\nWe note that the site contains one existing house and that the application replaces this house and makes provision for three additional new houses.\\nOne additional house can be built as of right and therefore the \"four or more\" rule is only triggered as the application is combined as only three additional new houses are being proposed for the site and an existing one is being replaced thus being four overall.\\n\\n4.0 NOTIFICATION ASSESSMENT\\n\\nPublic notification assessment (sections 95A, 95C-95D) Section 95A specifies the steps the council is to follow to determine whether an application is to be publicly notified.\\nThese steps are addressed in the statutory order below.\\n\\nStep 1: mandatory public notification in certain circumstances No mandatory notification is required as:\\n\\n* the applicant has not requested that the application is publicly notified (s95A(3)(a));\\n\\n* there are no outstanding or refused requests for further information (s95C and s95A(3)(b));

This gradient has had to exceed this standard due to the rising topography of the site adjacent to the street.\\nThere is an existing waste water manhole within the proposed driveway area and in order to keep the levels the same and avoid the necessity for additional drainage work on Councils infrastructure it has been proposed that the levels for the driveway remain the same as the manhole lid-level.\\nThe proposed design is the best design as per the site topography and layout.\\nIt is the best fit, to limit the amount of earthworks through this part of the site and still provides ease of access into the dwellings once a vehicle is on the site.\\nWe further note that the access is on the downward slope to the carriageway and therefore still allows for adequate clearance & sightlines exiting the site.\\nIt is this aspect and this alone which makes the application discretionary.\\nThe overall adverse effects are no more than minor with the positive benefit of retaining the existing waste water line manhole at its present level.\\nServices For all of the services, Stormwater, wastewater and utilities please refer to the Appendix C.

CITY\\n\\nDear Sir\\n\\nRE*. 4 BINSTED ROAD AND NOTICE OF OBJECTION TO FEES FOR RESOURCE CONSENT RMA 20064171 AND 20064201\\n\\nI refer to your electronic mail dated 6 June 2007 in which you object to the fees of RMA O 20020280.\\n\\nYour objection has been considered and I wish to advise you of the following.\\n\\nYou raise concern regarding difference between the amount of fees that you have already paid, and the additional fees associated with specialist input.\\nI am advised that you have paid $6,668.00, and the full cost of processing the resource consents was $6,684.12.\\nThe Council will waive the difference between the amount paid and the amount levied (which amounts to $16.12).\\nEssentially the specialist fees associated with the processing of this resource consent application have been covered by the amount you have already paid.\\n\\nIn terms of your objection to the administration costs, these costs are split into three portions.\\nThe administration cost of $623.00 covers the costs associated with the limited notification and advertising of your application, and the associated administration arrangements.\\nThis amount is a reasonable reflection of that task.\\n\\nThe general administration and subdivision administration fees are clearly separate and relate to the land use consent and the subdivision consent respectively, and each amount is a reasonable reflection of the administration of those tasks.\\n\\no\\n\\nIn terms of the Team Leader Consult fee of $1274, the Team leader involved in this resource consent is overseas at present, attending to family matters.\\nI will discuss this fee with him when he returns.\\nIf the amount of this fee is to be reduced, the Council will refund you the appropriate amount.\\n\\nDECISION\\n\\nBased on the reasons set out in this letter, Council makes the following decision in relation to the Section 357 objection toRMA 20064171 AND 20064201\\n\\nThe objection to the fees is upheld and a waiver in fees of $16.12 is recommended.\\nThe unutilised base fee will be used to meet the costs associated with specialist input into the processing of the applications.\\n\\nThe objection to the administration fees is not upheld, and the allocated fees will remain.\\n\\nThe objection to the Team Leader consult fees are on hold, pending further consideration by the Council once the relevant staff are available to review this matter.\\n\\nThis decision is made by the undersigned acting under delegated authority pursuant to Section 34A of the Resource Management Act 1991.\\n\\nPlease contact the writer for any further queries.\\n\\nYours faithfully\\n\\nEryn Shields Principal Planner: Resource Management\\n\\no\\n\\nCR\\xc3\\x89
